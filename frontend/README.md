the project consist of contact details in the tabular format where we can do 4 main operations view , add ,edit and delete.
1. add: clicking on add new contact button will open new page which contains form of contact details fill the form click on submit to add new contact to database.
2. edit: edit button is placed to every row adjacent to contact detail which open new page with all the entries make a changes in it and submit to edit contact
